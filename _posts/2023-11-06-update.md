This is going to be another short one. 

I think it would be a good idea to give my writings a little time to marinate before posting them to the world. So, I’m going to try posting a week after I finish writing something.

Doing this should give me a chance to revisit my writings and make edits as needed, which has at least two major benefits.

1. Practice revising my work
2. Hopefully, posting higher quality writing

With that, I will not have anything else to post until next week.

See ya then.
