11 years seems like such a short amount of time. But in this short amount of time, we have experienced so much. We have experienced 11 years of life, in the deepest meaning of the word.  We laughed and snickered, and doubled over crying with one another during the greatest joys. And we stood together, silent, emotionally broken, during the hardest of times. And all throughout, we have managed to love each other a little more every day. And I mean the all-encompassing kind of love. The “will the good of the other” type of love. You wrote about how your love increased after seeing me honor, serve, and protect. I can assure you that whatever sacrifices I made pale in comparison to what you did for my father. You are quite simply the best thing that’s happened to me outside of my faith. Thank for living this life with me. 

Love, 

Paul
