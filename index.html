            <p>
                I think I am going to try this whole blogging thing for a few reasons.
                I need another web development project to work on. I want to try writing
                every day, and figured it would be a little easier if I have somewhere to 
                put my writing. I also think this may be a good way to track my progress
                to becoming a generalist.
